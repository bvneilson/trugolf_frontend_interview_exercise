# E6Golf Frontend Developer Exercise

## Brennan's Notes

The purpose of this exercise is for the developer to exhibit familiarity with frontend technologies, programming patterns and to provide a sample of what clean and reusable code means to the candidate.

Please add any comments about your decisions you have made inline, and give a summary about the architectural choices the you made and/or considered.

Hello Clint, Chris and TruGolf team! Thank you so very much for spending the time to interview me and get to know me. You've invested so much time and effort into my candidacy and I appreciate this developer exercise that you created. I had a lot of fun trying my best to impress you and my goal has always been to reciprocate your investment of time/resources with my best effort.

For this project, I tried to showcase a wide variety of strategies/competence in Vue component architecture and coding patterns. It didn't turn out as perfectly as I'd planned during this time allotment, but I appreciate you looking over it anyway. I stayed with Vue 2 and Vuetify - thank you so much for building those things in. I went with a basic v-simple-table to display shot data. I'd like to move that to v-data-table and build in some good column filtering table-wide. Also, the graph on single-shot modals has a bug where the wedges/irons don't work like the Woods for example. My time was cut short but I'd have liked to iron that out and display some data points to show "this shot" vs "other shots/avg" etc. I love working with data and golf data makes it even more thrilling. I have so many ideas to implement with this, which speaks to the wonderful canvas you created to work on. I had planned to create some more "api" calls as you'd given me some sample user data. I had planned to create a simple user page and link some user data into that single-shot modal and a separate 18-hole page. I had some fun toggling between shotsNine.json and shotsEighteen.json.

I tried my best to write concise, self-documenting code.

I have absolutely loved what I've seen of TruGolf and the people there. I would love nothing more than to come join you and apply my full talent and efforts toward helping you build the company/products for your great customers. No matter what you decide, thank you again for your time spent with me! You are awesome and I wish you the absolute best!

Thanks,
Brennan Neilson
